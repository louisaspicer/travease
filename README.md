Make travel planning easy.

### About
This is a React Native project written in Typescript.

The goal of this app is to make planning your travels easier by:

- Find places of interest, as well as options on how to travel between them depending on your budget.
- Creating a personal itinerary with all the details you need.
- Uploading any documents you need so you can have them in one place, e.g. plane, train, restaurant booking confirmations.

Initially, this app's main destination will be The Philippines.
